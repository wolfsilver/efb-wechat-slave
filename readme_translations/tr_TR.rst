**Channel ID**: ``blueset.wechat``

EWS is an EFB Slave Channel for WeChat, based on reversed engineered
WeChat Web API, modified ``wxpy``, and ``itchat``.

Some source code in this repository was adapted from `youfou/wxpy
<https://github.com/youfou/wxpy>`_ and `littlecodersh/ItChat
<https://github.com/littlecodersh/ItChat/>`_.


Alpha Version
=============

This is an unstable alpha version, and its functionality may change at
any time.


Attention
=========

Since mid-2016, we have received feedback where some users’ access to
Web WeChat was banned. Most of the users were unbanned within 1 week
to 3 months. When a user is banned for Web WeChat access, a pop up
would be shown when they try to use it, stating that they “cannot use
Web WeChat temporary”, and are recommended to “use mobile app or
Windows/macOS instead”.

The ban will NOT affect your access to any other client. The cause of
such ban is not clear.

Please proceed with caution, and avoid using this Channel if you have
special need of Web WeChat access. Learn more in the Project Wiki.

FAQ
===

* **How to switch to another WeChat account?** Please log out from
   your phone, and log in again with another one.

* **How to log in with multiple WeChat accounts?** Please indicate
   different Instance ID in the profile’s config file.

* **Is EWS stable?** EWS depends on `ItChat
   <https://github.com/littlecodersh/ItChat>`_ project and Web WeChat
   protocol. According to `ItChat FAQ
   <https://itchat.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/FAQ/>`_ a stable session
   that lasts over months is possible when you:

   * have a stable internet connection on your server, and

   * **keep your WeChat app always online**.


Known Issues
============

* Due to the design of Web WeChat, chats with no name or identical
   name might be identified as the same chat, which might lead to
   misdelivery of messages.

* Similarly, in limited situations, a chat will be seen as a “new
   chat” when its name is changed, and the “old chat” is thus
   disappeared.

* Only features supported by Web WeChat are supported by EWS, which
   means: - No “Moments” - No money transfers - Cannot send voice
   messages - Cannot send locations - etc.

* Some multimedia files (pictures, stickers, files, etc.) might be
   blocked by Web WeChat, and no data is received, especially for
   stickers. In such cases, you will be reminded to check your phone.

help to translate this project into your languages on `our Crowdin
